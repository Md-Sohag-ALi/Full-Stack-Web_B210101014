# Full-Stack-Web_B210101014
### ✅ Day 1 Progress (25 February 2026)

Today I successfully completed the initial configuration and setup of the Django project for my Full Stack Web Development course.

#### 🔧 Environment Setup
- Created and activated a virtual environment to maintain project dependency isolation.
- Installed Django framework using pip.
- Initialized a new Django project.

#### 📂 Project Structure Analysis
- Explored and understood the Django project architecture.
- Analyzed the purpose of core files:
  - `manage.py` – Project management and command-line utility.
  - `settings.py` – Main configuration file.
  - `urls.py` – URL routing configuration.
  - `asgi.py` & `wsgi.py` – Deployment configuration files.
- Observed automatic creation of the SQLite database (`db.sqlite3`).

#### 🚀 Execution
- Successfully ran the Django development server.
- Verified the project by accessing the default Django welcome page in the browser.

The development environment is now fully configured and ready for application-level implementation.
